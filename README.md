# Visualizing_Interference_Fringe
In this project, the interference fringe created due to superposition of monochromatic light waves originating from two coherent point sources separated by a small distance relative to the distance between the sources and the screen are shown using MATLAB code.

# Problem Statement
Suppose you have two coherent (same frequency and phase) point light sources which are h distance apart. There is an interference pattern on a screen which is D distance from the sources. You are required to show the interference pattern. (The concept is similar to the Young's double slit experiment). (see any physics text book and MATLAB functions: image, imshow, colormap for preliminary studies)
